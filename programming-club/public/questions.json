    "ans": "React is a library that allows you to write JavaScript components. It uses a syntax similar to XML, and the markup of the components is a mix between HTML and XML.It uses a technology called the “Virtual DOM” to manage updates. Virtual DOM is just another way of saying a big object with all the components rendered on the page and their properties. Whenever one of them changes, React knows what to do.For event handling, React registers a global event handler (on the HTML or Body element) and whenever events come through that listener, it takes on the responsibility to propagate the proper events and trigger the right handlers within components further down the chain.",
